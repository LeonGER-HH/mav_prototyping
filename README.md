# mav_prototyping

please just run the floor_detection.py file

I put an environment file that might help in case you don't have the packages already installed, there is some annoying conflict between versions between OpenCV and Numpy iirc, but this is resolved in this environment. The output should be a few images with:
- original image
- filtered using the SVM classifier
- removal of small clusters
